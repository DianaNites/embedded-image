# Embedded image

A terribly bad `no_std` image handling crate,
written by a being with little graphics or math experience

This is being written out of necessity, because none of the existing libraries
support `no_std` for some reason.

The code and design and math is likely bad if you actually know the subject.
please do help, i just want to resize an image in `no_std` with good quality,
programmers only go down rabbit holes learning and implementing new fields
when VERY distressed!
